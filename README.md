# Content Learning Market Place 
> A brief description of a project :
We are introducing this web-based application for users who can earn and learn using this application.
The application will be based on an e-learning subscription base platform that helps students to learn new technologies or enhance their skills to get high-paid salary jobs.
Students in this platform will get a certificate after gaining some skills.
The main features of our project are Login/Register (Social Auth), Teachers can upload their content in video format,
Users can choose our subscription plan according to their own choice and view the content in which syllabus and topics are included before buying.
A teacher can handle their content by viewing and uploading. After completing a course user must have an Assessment test to get a certificate. For subscriptions,
we will use the Stripe Payment Method to handle the subscriptions of users. Our platform will payout to content uploaders after cutting platform fees.

### What problem does it (intend to) solve?

 Teachers do not know about the students whether he/she is listening to the lecture or not. There is another problem to mark the attendance of the students manually.
